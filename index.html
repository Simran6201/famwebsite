                <p>Mumma, you are the first person who ever held me. Before I knew what comfort was, I already had it—wrapped in your arms, resting against your heartbeat. You’ve given me a thousand little sacrifices disguised as routines. You skipped your
                    dreams so I could find mine. You fed me love before I even knew hunger.</p>
                <p>You are the quiet lullaby that still plays in my head on the hardest days. I hope you know: every time I smile, it’s because of a piece of joy you passed to me. Every time I rise, it’s because of the ground you built beneath me.</p>

                    <li>Packing my favorite food without asking.</li>
                    <li>Encouraging me when I was too scared to try.</li>
                    <li>Protecting me from your own worries so I’d stay carefree.</li>

                <p>Daddy, you may not have said “I love you” with words often, but I’ve heard it a million times in your actions. In your early mornings and late nights. In the way you’d check on me silently while pretending not to worry. In the times you
                    carried burdens silently so I wouldn’t have to.</p>
                <p>If Mumma is the heart of the home, you are its spine. You kept us standing even when the winds tried to knock us over.</p>
